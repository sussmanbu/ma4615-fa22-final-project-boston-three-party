<p>As we know, climate change continues to be one of the greatest existential threats to our future and our planet. The three biggest causes of this threat are burning fossil fuels, cutting down forests, and farming livestock which add enormous amounts of greenhouse gases to those naturally occurring in the atmosphere. The topic of combating global warming is currently being discussed widely, with leaders all over the world coming up with solutions to slow down this catastrophe. Our group decided to take a further look into CO2 emissions and other various factors that contribute to this global threat in the past 50 years. We also decided to do further analysis on crop production in the United States to see the connection between certain crops and various climate variables.</p>

We have started to graph the change in more variables over time, specifically, X Y and Z variables.

We've decided to expand on our analysis of crop production and CO2 emissions by examining the correlation between the two variables. We're in the process of creating correlation plots using a pearson correlation coefficient test, as well as running a spearman correlation test to find if there is a statistically significant correlation between 2 variables. The main correlation we want to examine is directly between CO2 output and crop output.

We decided that instead of adding a third dataset, we would examine other variables in the second dataset which might provide insight into other factors. For example, we are using price as a metric for demand for crops and comparing that to GDP expenditures from the original dataset to examine the relationship between the two.

Our thesis so far has not changed and our data still supports the idea that increased human activity leads to a decrease in crop output.

We have also started working on our interactive using Shiny. We want to incorporate the growth/decline in certain crops throughout the last 50 years into an interactive using a scatterplot that changes within time.

We've included in this blogpost two correlation plots between barley production and co2 emissions, the second without autocorrelation.

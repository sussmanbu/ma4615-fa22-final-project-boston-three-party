One of the requirements for your project is that you bring together multiple datasets to enable a more in depth analysis. This could be including weather data based on dates, including demographic data based on location, among many other possibilities.

For this week\'s blog post, please describe the datasets you are combining, how you are combining them, and what your initial findings were. Also, were there any difficulties in combining the data? If you haven\'t finished combining datasets, that is fine, just discuss where you are in the process and what your next steps are.

Our CO2 emissions vs. Year graph shows a bell-shaped curve of increasing then decreasing CO2 emissions, with the peak around the year 2000. Our initial prediction is that this reduction in recent years reflects the increased conservation efforts to reduce emissions. We need to manipulate this graph to make the y-axis continuous. Our population growth vs. Time graph illustrates the changes in annual population growth over time.

Our new dataset is agriculture data from World Bank. It includes variables such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing value added (% of GDP), irrigated land (% of total agricultural land), machinery and tractors, agricultural methane/nitrous oxide emissions, raw materials exports/imports, crop production index, livestock production index, % of rural population, and annual freshwater withdrawals. We chose this dataset because it could potentially help us find a deeper understanding of CO2 emissions and other variables that account for the rise of emissions. Although we still have to do exploratotry analysis, our initial findings show that there has been a decline in agricultural land, machinery and tractors, raw materials exports, and % rural population in the past 50 years in the United States. Conversely, there has been an increase in agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emissions, crop production, livestock production index, and annual freshwater withdrawals. This is an interesting dataset to analyze, and will add plenty to our current research about CO2 emissions.

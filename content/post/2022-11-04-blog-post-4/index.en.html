<p>After identifying some of the big obvious trends in the data, we have come to the conclusion that most variables are not independent of one another. For example, population growth and forest area % are highly correlated, as are exports of goods and services and GDP growth, and therefore the trends are less interesting than if the input variables were truly independent. We will likely need to search for other datasets to find more interesting trends. A wider breadth of data will help us to accomplish this. For example, more specific economic data as it relates to CO2 emissions could prove more interesting in data analysis. Data about transportation, manufacturing, technology, and conservation efforts may also help us discover interesting intersections between human production and the effects of climate change.
We may also consider datasets which include countries outside the US. This could also help us compare how conservation efforts are in different places, and whether the economic status of a country influences its CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Our response variable will likely be CO2 emissions, and we are working to collect more variables to use as predictors. Our predictor variables will now focus more around economic variables such as GDP growth, transportation, technology, manufacturing, and exports.</p>

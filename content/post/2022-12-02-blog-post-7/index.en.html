<p>We are still hard at work on our exploratory data analysis. In addition to crop production, we are examining multiple other factors concerning the crops in our second dataset, including area planted and harvested and pricing. We are comparing these factors to the original CO2 emissions as well as to the forest area percent variable, to determine if thereâ€™s a correlation between crop area and forest area. We are also comparing the crops to one another to see if there is any difference between their production and output.</p>
<p>We are also considering adding a third dataset with just CO2 data, since the original dataset we used only had CO2 emission data from 1990 onward while our crop data and other features on the original CO2 dataset go as far back as the 1970s. Other datasets that only focus of CO2 output from the US go back farther which would provide us with slightly more data to strengthen our analysis.</p>
<p>We are still finalizing our tentative thesis based off our time series, but based of our current data analysis our thesis is as follows. If CO2 emissions continue to increase, paired alongside various other harmful variables related to human development such as population growth, economic growth, and deforestation, then we will see a decrease in the amount of crops produced. Indeed, while deforestation is often seen as a solution for lack of farming productivity, the net effects of climate change seem to outweigh the increase in space for farmland.</p>
<p>The other potential thesis we had discussed was
Thesis: as co2 increases crop output decreases - we see this in our time series
Other thesis - CO2 increases more with more human development</p>
<p>We can use ManipulateWidget for our crops time series graph since it has a variety of interesting features. The period feature can allow the user to see graphs for certain time periods. This would be good for analysis of trying to analyze data for specific time frames. More specifically, we plan to allow the user to be able to look at crop outputs in the future in the next 5-10 years using a time series based off of our existing data. We will be mostly using line graphs since we are talking about data over a period of time.</p>
